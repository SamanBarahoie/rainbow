Animations

Pulse: Text fades in and out by toggling between normal and dim text.
Wave: Colors cycle through the selected theme, creating a wave-like effect.

Note: Pulse and wave animations cannot be used together.
Requirements

Bash: The script requires a Bash shell (/bin/bash). It checks for this automatically and will exit if run with a different shell.
Terminal: A terminal that supports ANSI color codes (most modern terminals do).

Limitations

Animations may not display correctly in non-interactive terminals or terminals with limited ANSI support.
The script assumes a UTF-8 compatible terminal for proper character rendering.
Large inputs with animations may cause slight performance delays due to terminal rendering.
